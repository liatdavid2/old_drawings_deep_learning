<b>Abstract: </b> This study offers a quantitative solution that automates the creation of a historical timeline
starting with old drawings from the beginning of the 18th century and ending with present-day
photographs of the Old City of Jerusalem. This is performed using GIScience approaches, computer
vision, and deep learning. The motivation to select the Old City of Jerusalem is the substantial
availability of old archival drawings and photographs, owing to the area’s significance throughout the
years. This task is challenging, as drawings, old photographs, and new photographs exhibit distinct
characteristics. Our method encompasses several key components for the analyses: a 2D location
recommendation engine, which detects an approximate location in the image of 3D landmarks; 2D
landmarks to 3D conversion; and 2D polygonal areas to 3D GIS polylines conversion. This is applied
to the segmentation of built areas. To achieve more accurate results, Meta’s Segment Anything model
was utilized, which eliminates the need for extensive data preparation, training, and validation, thus
optimizing the process. Using such techniques enabled us to examine the landscape development
throughout the last three centuries and gain deeper insights concerning the evolution of prominent
landmarks and features such as built area over time.
